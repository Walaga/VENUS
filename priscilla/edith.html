  <p> My name is Priscilla Walaga.I am a final year student of Computer Engineering at Makerere University.
    <br> Currently am on my journey to becoming a front end developer with the help of Outbox EDU prep programe.</br>
    <br> I am interested in Software development so as to integrate it with Artificial Intelligence. I am currently working on a pothole detection system using machine learning.
    I love to read novels, read about new technologies,travel,watch movies and meet new people.</br></p>

      <p>This project involves training a machine learning model that can detect potholes and the location where these potholes are found.These details are stored in a database that can be used by UNRA or KCCA during road repair exercises.The project is in its final stages of training the model with pothole images and later will be rolled out.</p>

      <p>This is just a small assignment where i was able to implement a few things i learnt about web development in the Outbox EDU prep VI class.It is a simple website using a few html tags and css learnt in the first 3weeks of the booycamp.The website is about a few facts about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep learning.         </p>
